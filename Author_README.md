# Roguelike Development with JavaScript

A sample game for the Apress Roguelike book

#  Loading samples

The source code for each sample include shared files from the third-party folder, so you need to run a web server
from the top level folder and navigate from there. [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)
is what I'm using to develop the code for the book.

## Installing live-server

Install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org

On a terminal install a globally available `live-server` with:

``` 
$ npm i -g live-server
```

## Running the samples

In the root level of this source code collection, execute `live-server`. Your browser will open with an interface to the file
system. Navigate to the desired sample.
